## Key Features

- **Unique Design**: Our project emphasizes a unique and visually appealing website design that sets it apart from existing templates or websites.

- **User-Friendly Navigation**: The website features a user-friendly navigation system with a top navbar, making it easy for users to access key sections like Home, Add Product, My Cart, and Login.

- **Product Management**: Users can add products with details like images, names, brand names, types, prices, short descriptions, and ratings. These product listings are private/protected routes, ensuring data security.

- **Brand Pages**: The project includes brand-specific pages where users can explore featured products and advertisements. Each product includes information such as images, names, brand names, types, prices, and ratings. In cases where a brand has no available products, a relevant message is displayed.

- **Authentication and User Profiles**: The website implements email and password-based authentication. Users can register, log in, and toggle between registration and login views. After logging in, the user's name, profile picture, and a logout button appear on the navbar.
